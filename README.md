# Covid-19Analysis

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on various demographic groups, highlighting the need to analyze mortality statistics by age and sex. This project leverages a detailed dataset from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on provisional COVID-19 deaths, categorized by these factors. 
Using exploratory data analysis, visualization techniques, and predictive modeling approaches such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN), time series analysis, and other machine learning algorithms, this study investigates trends, patterns, and correlations in COVID-19 mortality rates. 
It explores connections between these rates and variables like pneumonia deaths, influenza deaths, and overall mortality across age and gender groups. Additionally, geographic differences and temporal variations are examined to provide actionable insights for public health interventions and policymaking. 
By analyzing this complex dataset, the study seeks to uncover significant patterns and relationships that can guide equitable healthcare policies and effective mitigation strategies.

This study is based on a dataset comprising approximately 100,000 records, providing a comprehensive and statistically reliable basis for analysis. A variety of analytical techniques—including Linear Regression, Neural Networks, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Scatter Plots, Bar Charts, Heatmaps, Time Series Analysis, and Random Forest Classifiers—are employed to address critical research questions:

# COVID-19 Deaths Analysis by Age & Sex

## 📊 Objective
To analyze COVID-19 death counts across different age groups and sex categories in the US, and identify trends, patterns, and predictive insights using machine learning and time series forecasting.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Prophet, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Key Analyses
1. **Sex-wise Comparison** using Linear Regression and Neural Networks.
2. **Age and Pneumonia Deaths Impact** via KNN Classifier.
3. **State-wise Deaths** Visualization.
4. **Time Series Forecasting** using Prophet (Year-wise and Month-wise).
5. **Influenza Deaths by Sex** using Random Forest Classification.

## 📈 Notable Insights
- Males had a higher number of COVID-19 related deaths.
- Strong correlation between Pneumonia and COVID-19 deaths.
- States show varied death counts; detailed in bar plot.
- Prophet predicts seasonal patterns in COVID-19 deaths.
